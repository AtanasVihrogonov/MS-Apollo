# MS Apollo

It's kind of a social media application, a sharing application, where users can add songs. And they can share them with other users that are using the app and they can play those songs. 

> Users are going to be able to grab songs from two different providers `YouTube` and `SoundCloud`. 

> You can grab a song from either one of these locations by just copying the address and pasting it to the app search. The app is going to determine whether it can be played by our App Player. And once it determines that that's the case, you can hit the play button. 

> The 'React player' itself going to grab information from the URL and it's going to enable you to edit the song's details. 

> You can also queue songs, so you can listen to given songs and if you have some songs saved to the queue they immediately after the end go to the next song.
